### Introduction

Mental health in the tech industry is becoming an increasingly important topic as the sector is rapidly growing and the fast-paced, high-pressure environment is putting more toll on the well-being of employees. The demand for professional excellence, long working hours and a known culture of overwork can lead to stress, anxiety, burnout and sometimes even more significant detioration of mental health.

In order to take a deeper look at this issue, we will be analyzing "The Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset" on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). This is a comprehensive collection of survey data compiled responses from tech industry professionals over several years (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019). The aim of this survey was to assess the prevalence of mental health issues in the tech industry and to understand the general attitutes towards mental health in the work enviroment. The survey contains whopping 105 questions, some of which are multiple choice, whereas others are open ended. We will be looking at a selected few of these to answer questions such: 

"what is the socioeconomical background of correspondents and are there evidence of sampling bias?"
"Are there discernible correlations between continuous numerical variables? If so, what are they and what do they show and how could they be interpreted?"
"What are the most common health issue problems in the tech industry and what are their prevalence rates? What is the certainly around the values obtained?"
"Is the mental health worse in the tech sector compared to the non-tech industry?"
"What are the best countries and US states for good mental health in the tech industry?"
"Does the size of tech company determine the attitute towards mental health issues? If so what is the pattern?

## Goal

The goal of this exploratory data analysis is to answer the mentioned questions and use the answers to these question to assess the mental health problem in the tech and suggest how mental health in this industry could be improved.

## How to use

Download the dataset (mental_health.sqlite) and the Jupyter Notebook file (M2S1_FINAL.ipynb). Make sure that both files are in the same directory. Then, simply open the .ipynb file and run all of the cells.
